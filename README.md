# Ransomware

🦠 Ransomware

‼️‼️WARNING: THIS IS REAL RANSOMWARE☣️ AND IT WILL ENCRYPT YOUR FILES‼️‼️

This is a simple Ransomware I designed using python and python libraries.


📁 Features:
- It contains a file "voldemort.py" this is the ransomware.
- It contains a file "decrypt.py" to decrypt your files.


📝 How it Works:
- first when "voldemort.py" is run it will encrypt all the files in its current directory.
- Then a file called "thekey.key" will be created containing the key to decrypt your files.
- the decrypt file "decrypt.py" when run it will look for "thekey.key" and use the key contained inside it to decrypt all encrypted files.


🧠 What I learned:
- I learned how ransomware works, and how to create it.
- This project further developed my programming skills, and particularly my Python abilities.


🚀 Future Improvements:
- Implementing a delivery system.
- Further developing the file discovery system to be able to go into directories and infect their contents.
- Implement a system to exfiltrate the key from the infected system.
